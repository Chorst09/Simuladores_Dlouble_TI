# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive RFP (Request for Proposal) and RFI (Request for Information) management system. The system will allow users to create, manage, track, and analyze RFPs and RFIs throughout their lifecycle, providing a centralized platform for managing procurement processes and business opportunities.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user saves an RFP/RFI THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and provide clear error messages for missing information
3. WHEN a user views the RFP/RFI list THEN the system SHALL display all RFPs/RFIs with key information in a sortable and filterable table
4. WHEN a user searches for RFPs/RFIs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time filtering by title, client, status, and category

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to track RFP/RFI status and deadlines, so that I can ensure timely responses and manage workload effectively.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sales manager, I want to categorize and organize RFPs/RFIs by industry and value, so that I can prioritize opportunities and allocate resources effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an RFP/RFI THEN the system SHALL allow selection from predefined categories (Saúde, Governo, Educação, Financeiro, etc.)
2. WHEN entering estimated value THEN the system SHALL accept monetary values and format them as Brazilian currency
3. WHEN filtering RFPs/RFIs THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by category, value range, and account manager
4. WHEN viewing RFP/RFI details THEN the system SHALL display all categorization information clearly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to edit and update RFP/RFI information, so that I can keep records current and accurate as situations change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks edit on an RFP/RFI THEN the system SHALL open a form pre-populated with current data
2. WHEN a user updates RFP/RFI information THEN the system SHALL validate changes and save updates immediately
3. WHEN editing is cancelled THEN the system SHALL revert to original data without saving changes
4. WHEN updates are saved THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation feedback to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to delete obsolete RFPs/RFIs, so that I can maintain a clean and relevant database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to delete an RFP/RFI THEN the system SHALL require confirmation before proceeding
2. WHEN deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the record from the database
3. WHEN deletion is cancelled THEN the system SHALL return to the previous view without changes
4. WHEN deletion is completed THEN the system SHALL update the list view and provide success confirmation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure data integrity and proper validation, so that the RFP/RFI database remains accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN required fields are empty THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission and highlight missing fields
2. WHEN date fields are entered THEN the system SHALL validate date formats and logical date relationships (deadline after publish date)
3. WHEN duplicate RFPs/RFIs are detected THEN the system SHALL warn users about potential duplicates
4. WHEN data is saved THEN the system SHALL perform server-side validation to ensure data integrity
