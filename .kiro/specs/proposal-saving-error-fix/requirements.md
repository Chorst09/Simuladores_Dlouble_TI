# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical error occurring when users attempt to save proposals through the Virtual Machines Calculator (MaquinasVirtuaisCalculator). The error "Erro na resposta da API: {}" indicates a failure in API communication that prevents users from successfully saving their proposal data, impacting the core functionality of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating a virtual machines proposal, I want the system to successfully save my proposal data, so that I can preserve my work and continue with the proposal process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the save proposal button in the Virtual Machines Calculator THEN the system SHALL successfully send the proposal data to the API
2. WHEN the API receives a valid proposal request THEN the system SHALL return a proper success response with confirmation data
3. WHEN the proposal is successfully saved THEN the system SHALL display a success message to the user
4. WHEN the proposal saving fails THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful error message explaining what went wrong

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback about the status of my proposal saving operation, so that I understand whether my data was saved successfully or if there was an error.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API request is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator to the user
2. WHEN the API returns an error response THEN the system SHALL parse and display the specific error message
3. WHEN the API response is malformed or empty THEN the system SHALL display a generic but helpful error message
4. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL inform the user about connection problems

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging in the proposal saving functionality, so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including request data and response details
2. WHEN the API response is unexpected THEN the system SHALL log the actual response structure for debugging
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the validation failures with context
4. IF the error logging fails THEN the system SHALL still attempt to show user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the proposal form to validate my input before attempting to save, so that I don't encounter preventable errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL highlight the missing fields and prevent submission
2. WHEN invalid data formats are detected THEN the system SHALL show validation messages before API submission
3. WHEN the form data is valid THEN the system SHALL proceed with the API request
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL focus on the first invalid field for user convenience
